title: About Chuck Yin

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>This is Chuck Yin, a hardware people. I have been working in different companies such as Facebook, Square, Apple and Qualcomm at the same field: manufacturing automation. 

			<strong><em>What is manufacturing automation? Why is that relevant? </em></strong><br>
			
			Well, before deeply diving into the details, I have to admit that my education is not automation related at all. I got my degree in display engineering field at Kent State University. I shift my gear into this automation field due to interest. Manufacturing automation, from my perspective, is a piece of art to scale up a hardware product from 1 to 1 million (or more). It mix the electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, machine vision, software engineering. Its ultimate form-factor product is the manufacturing line with a lot of manufacturing assembly or test stations as its building block. It has metrics, but no standard. It help make standard product, but itself is non-standard. It intrinsically is to build a hardware which makes hardware. <br>

			Due to its ad-hoc nature, all kinds of hardware/software bugs shows up, and it all ends up with one failure: Not working. My job is to hunt for the ghost like bugs, to embed my soul into the station, to progress iteratively, and finally to make it work! I enjoy the challenge! <br>

			<strong><em>What do I do other than working? </em></strong><br>

			Due to the job nature, I travelled a lot. The trip usually happened after a strenuous build support, or holiday season. I do not mind going to very exotic places like east Africa or Cambodia to experience different cultures. So far, the collection of check-in covers 30 countries, I learned from every place I've been to. I enjoy the trip!<br>
			When I am not travelling and not working, I like to make stuff. Most of them are for fun and have no practical applications, such as one-axis actuator equipped with fiber camera to classify garbage into different containers. There are some other projects on-going, once they appear out of stealth mode, I will post them out here.<br>
